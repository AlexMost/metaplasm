title: About me
---

I am currently the Assistant Director of Research and Development at 
the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](http://mith.umd.edu/)
at the [University of Maryland, College Park](http://www.umd.edu).

I'm from Texas.
My undergraduate thesis was on Henry James's last few novels, and several years ago I earned an M.A. in English at the
[University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/) for
work on copyright cases involving Percy Shelley and Lord Byron
(see [this blog](http://terminalirony.com/) for some details).
While I was at Texas I was active in the [Computational Linguistics Lab](http://www.utcompling.com/people/students)
and worked on a number of natural language processing projects, including
[TextGrounder](https://bitbucket.org/utcompling/textgrounder),
[Shalmaneser](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/projects/salsa/shal/),
and [MSTParser](https://github.com/travisbrown/mstparser).
<!--I also worked on digitization projects for the [Walt Whitman Archive](http://whitmanarchive.org/).-->

Part of the work I do at MITH involves writing programs in
[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).
I also write Scala and [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell) for fun,
and to make myself feel less guilty about not working on the dissertation I need to write for my English Ph.D.
Some of my projects are on [GitHub](https://github.com/travisbrown/).
I used to be more active on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/334519/travis-brown),
but I've almost got that under control.
I collect computers, and most of them run [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/).
I like functional programming, type systems,
[macro systems](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/scala-macros/topusers),
[type-level programming](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless),
and machine learning.
I [take photographs](http://www.flickr.com/photos/travisbrown/),
[sometimes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/travisbrown/sets/72157632492975714/)
[for](http://www.flickr.com/photos/travisbrown/sets/72157632484974739/)
[MITH](http://www.flickr.com/photos/travisbrown/sets/72157631427840226/),
but mostly for fun.

I occasionally do contract programming work.
My [Stack Overflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/334519/travis-brown)
should give you an idea of my areas of expertise and interest.
