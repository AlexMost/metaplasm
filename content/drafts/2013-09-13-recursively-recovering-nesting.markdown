My colleague [Jim Smith](https://twitter.com/jgsmith) and I have just been discussing
some code related to the [Shared Canvas](http://www.shared-canvas.org/) viewer that
we're working on for the [Shelley-Godwin Archive](http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/).
The goal of the code is to recover a hierarchical structure from a flattened list of
labeled ranges.

In Scala terms, we've got something like this (using Jim's example data):

``` scala
val ranges = Map(
  "apple"                 -> ( 0, 11),
  "banana"                -> (11, 20),
  "appleArtichoke"        -> ( 0,  3),
  "appleBanana"           -> ( 4,  7),
  "appleCranberry"        -> ( 8, 11),
  "appleArtichokeApricot" -> ( 0,  2),
  "appleArtichokeBBQ"     -> ( 3,  4),
  "appleBananaApricot"    -> ( 5,  7),
  "appleCranberryApricot" -> ( 8,  9),
  "appleArtichokeBBQ"     -> (10, 11)
)
```

And we want to recover a tree structure with a label at each node.
We'll assume here that the ranges don't overlap in ways that would break our hierarchy,
but explicitly validating this isn't too hard.

While looking at Jim's CoffeeScript implementation this morning, I realized that there's a very simple recursive solution (here in Scala, using [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz)'s rose trees):

``` scala
import scalaz._, std.string._

def collectChildren(ranges: List[(String, (Int, Int))]): Stream[Tree[String]] =
  ranges match {
    case Nil => Stream.empty
    case (label, (_, last)) :: rest =>
      val (inside, outside) = rest.span(_._2._1 < last)
      Tree.node(label, collectChildren(inside)) #:: collectChildren(outside)
  }

def rangeNestings(ranges: Map[String, (Int, Int)]) = collectChildren(
  ranges.toList.sortBy {
    case (_, (first, last)) => (first, -last)
  }
)
```

This works as expected:

``` scala
scala> rangeNestings(ranges).foreach(tree => println(tree.drawTree))
"apple"
|
+- "appleArtichoke"
|  |
|  `- "appleArtichokeApricot"
|
+- "appleBanana"
|  |
|  `- "appleBananaApricot"
|
`- "appleCranberry"
   |
   +- "appleCranberryApricot"
   |
   `- "appleArtichokeBBQ"

"banana"
```

This struck me as an interesting kind of recursionâ€”we're dividing the elements into
two groups with `span`, recursively processing the first group...
