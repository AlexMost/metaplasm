Today is my last day at Twitter (well, kind of—my email access was unceremoniously shut off this
morning, so I've been spending the day reading a novel).

I'm not sure how I feel about this yet. After some very recent changes in the Twitter Open Source
team, I'd been thinking of leaving the company anyway, and I'm not a proud person, so I have no
complaints about doing that with a severance package. Jack and I disagree about whether the package
should be called ["generous"][jack], but I can live with it.

If I tried to recruit you to work at Twitter recently, my apologies—I had no idea this was coming. I
still think it's a great place to work, even though (like most of the rest of the world) I don't
have much confidence in its leadership or product direction. There are lots of incredibly smart and
generous people at Twitter. In fact in my experience pretty much everyone at least three or four
steps from the top of the org chart fits that description. You should probably work there if you get
the chance.

I was told literally nothing about Twitter's plans for the [Twitter Open Source][twitter-oss] team,
which for the last couple of weeks has consisted of two of us. If you're using Twitter open source
software, you're probably okay, especially if you're using a project like [Finagle][finagle] that's
owned by a team that cares a lot about open source. Because the Open Source team has never been
larger than three people, individual engineering teams have always been primarily responsible for
maintaining their own open source projects, and I'm assuming that's not going to change.

I'll miss pretending to be [@finagle][finagle-twitter] on Twitter, but I know I'm leaving the
account in good hands with the Core System Libraries team.

If you're reading this, you probably have some idea about the kind of work I like to do. If you've
got that kind of work, get in touch (preferrably [on Twitter][me]). I'm planning to take off at
least a couple of months to read, work on open source projects (including [Finch][finch]!), and
maybe learn some more Rust or Idris or something, but I'm keeping my eyes open.
